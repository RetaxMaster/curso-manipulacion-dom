✨ Every commit pushed to your `main` branch will autopublish the site on GitHub Pages.


#### Optional install using Yarn:

```sh
npx create-snowpack-app my-app --template snowpack-template-tailwind --use-yarn
```



## Features

- Snowpack, of course.
- Tailwind.
- Prettier.
- Force prettier on commit.
- Autopublish on Github Pages.

### Q: How do I enable auto publish to GitHub Pages?

1. Create a new Snowpack app using the script from the [quick start](#quick-start) section.
1. Update the value of `homepage` in `package.json`. It should like `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>` (no trailing slash).
1. Push your changes into a new GitHub repository.
1. You should see an Action running on `https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>/actions`
1. Make sure to [enable GitHub pages for your repo](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source) and select the `gh-pages` branch
1. Give GH Pages some minutes, your site should be live on `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>`
1. Enjoy :)

### Q: How do I disable auto publish to GitHub Pages?

Remove the `.github/workflows/publish.yml` file.

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like [@snowpack/plugin-webpack](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/tree/master/plugins/plugin-webpack) or [snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle](https://github.com/ParamagicDev/snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle) to your `snowpack.config.json` config file.

### Q: What about Eject?

No eject needed! Snowpack guarantees zero lock-in, and CSA strives for the same.
